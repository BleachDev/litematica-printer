Litematica Printer
==============
Quick fork of [litematica](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica) that uses the old schematica printer which places blocks automatically and airplaces, works on 1.17/1.17.1 and forked from [this build](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica/commit/79c6efedbe1acc6d6a3b08ad8094f0b32990285b).

Didn't bother to add another setting so to enable the printer simply turn on easy place.
